			<h1> Where It All Began  </h1>

			<hr class="hrr">
           <p>The story began in the Caribbean Sea with a vacation gone awry. Upon leaving his valuables on the beach unattended, Don Halpern became the latest unfortunate victim of daylight robbery. Having been stripped of nearly all his worldly possessions, Don began his search for a theft proof bag. After fruitlessly scouring the internet for a quality solution, Don happened upon a novel and innovative idea - a lockable backpack that would be both stylish and technically outstanding. Thus, the LOCTOTE® was born.</p>

     		<h3>Our Kickstarter Roots</h3>
     		<p>Our first LOCTOTE® was launched on Kickstarter in 2016. We became, at that time, the highest grossing backpack ever in the history of Kickstarter. From there, we were invited onto ABC's hit series, Shark Tank, where we made a sweet deal. Through it all, we have never strayed from our core focus of providing a means for the everyday explorer to live more and worry less.</p>
